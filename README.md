HOA is a new generation token.

-Deflationary (it burns profits with each transaction carried out) and also refracts the same percentage of said operation among all holders of the currency. but unlike    its predecessors, HOA will not charge fees on community assets, but the refracted amount will come out of a sealed account in the creation of the token itself. Thus      guaranteeing the reward of all members of your community.
